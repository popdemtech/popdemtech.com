the world we see is the symbol of death

belief in its existance is death of the belief in self.

Real Self.

It is possible to relearn this Self.

This is the Self that Creates.

I need you to understand that I am talking about some new shit
that there's no way you possibly understand if you believe the world of
death and separation.

You don't understand what this "Creation" is yet...
That's why you think suffering is possible.
That's why I think it's possible.

It's possible to relearn creation.

Relearn Creation.

How I got enlightened:

I read this book 100% of the way through.

I lived a life leading up to the point of reading this book,
then I read this book, and things started to make sense.
